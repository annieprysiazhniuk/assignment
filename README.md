# Assignment 5: HTML/CSS Webpage

Your job is to create a web site that has the following elements. Make sure all of your code is
arranged properly and cleanly. Your task is to create a one-page personal portfolio website (i.e.
digital resume). Make sure your page has some kind of common theme/topic, not just random stuff!
Remember to think about design when creating your project. I have included some example sites for
